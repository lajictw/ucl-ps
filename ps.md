# UCL申请

​	Since infancy, I have been intrigued as to how anything I came into contact with worked; however, the explanations I received were always either too vague or beyond my knowledge at the time, I have came to realize that the keyword for all my questions was artificial intelligence, where the most complex phenomena of the universe can be explained by fitting small pieces of the puzzle into a structured theory. My passion for quantifying everything in the daily life is another factor in my choice of artificial intelligence as a degree subject. I find nearly all complex problems in the daily life can be solved with the help of the model provided by the artificial intelligence, and this enables me to embrace artificial intelligence more than a major, or a degree, but as a personal passionate.
